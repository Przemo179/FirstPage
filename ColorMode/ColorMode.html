                <br>In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s. Fruits are the means by which <a class="pointedWords" href="">flowering plants</a>
                (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. Neat own nor she said see walk. And charm add green you these. Sang busy in this drew ye fine.
                Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and <a class="pointedWords" href="">animals</a>
                In a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other;
                in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output,
                and some (such as the apple and thepomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.
                In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries.
                In botanical usage, the term "fruit" also includes many structures that are not commonly called "fruits" in everyday language, such as nuts, bean pods, <a class="pointedWords" href="">corn kernels</a>
                An <a class="pointedWords" href="">orange</a>
                is a fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae (see list of plants known as orange); it primarily refers to Citrus sinensis, which is also called sweet orange,
                to distinguish it from the related Citrus aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony) varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations.
                The orange is a hybrid between pomelo <a class="pointedWords" href="">(Citrus maxima)</a> and mandarin (Citrus reticulata).The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo. 
                The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced.
                The orange originated in a region encompassing Southern China, Northeast India, and Myanmar,and the earliest mention of the sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC. 
                As of <a class="pointedWords" href="">1987</a>, orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world. Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit. 
                The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel. As of 2012, sweet oranges accounted for approximately 70% of citrus production.
                In 2019, 79 million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide, with 
                <a class="pointedWords" href="">Brazil</a> producing 22% of the total, followed by <a class="pointedWords" href="">China</a> and <a class="pointedWords" href="">India</a>.
